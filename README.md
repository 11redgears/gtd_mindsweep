I tend to appreciate the feeling of doing this task physically with a pen and stickynotes, but as I begin learning python I thought this would be a good starting project. It is very basic and does not have exception handling.

- Start by adding items to a list, each acting as a physical 'stickynote'
- Ability to sort all items in the list by 3 common mind sweep categories, Family, Work, House
- Print list on screen
- Write sorted list to file
